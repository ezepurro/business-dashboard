# 📊 Business Dashboard

> A modern Business Intelligence platform for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), transforming Excel and CSV files into interactive dashboards, KPIs, and automated business insights.

> **Project Status:** 🚧 Active Development

---

# Overview

Business Dashboard is a Full Stack Business Intelligence platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses transform raw spreadsheet data into actionable business insights.

The application enables users to upload Excel or CSV datasets, automatically process them, generate KPIs, visualize business metrics, and explore analytical reports through an intuitive dashboard.

The project follows a modular service-oriented architecture, separating business logic from analytical processing to ensure scalability, maintainability, and future AI integration.

# Features

## Dataset Storage

Datasets are stored using a hybrid storage architecture:

- MongoDB stores dataset metadata.
- MinIO stores the original files.
- Express never stores binary files inside MongoDB.
- Future analytics services will read datasets directly from MinIO using object coordinates.

## Authentication

- User registration
- Secure login
- JWT Access Tokens
- Refresh Token rotation
- HttpOnly Cookie authentication
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Role-based authorization
- Protected routes

## Business Intelligence

- Company management
- CSV / Excel upload, stored in MinIO (Object Storage) via a `StorageProvider` abstraction — never in MongoDB
- Dataset upload
- Dataset management
- Dataset processing
- KPI generation
- Interactive dashboards
- Analysis history

## Future Features

- PDF report generation
- Excel export
- Custom dashboards
- Time period comparison
- Forecasting models
- AI recommendations
- Natural language querying

## Responsibilities

### Frontend

- User Interface
- Authentication
- Dashboard visualization
- Charts
- Forms
- API consumption

### Express API

- Authentication
- Business logic
- Company management
- Dataset management
- File uploads, persisted to MinIO through a `StorageProvider` abstraction
- Authorization
- Notifying the Analytics Service (dataset coordinates only, never the file itself)

- OpenAPI documentation

### Analytics Service

- Reads dataset files directly from MinIO (never through Express)
- Dataset processing
- Data cleaning
- KPI calculation
- Statistical analysis
- Forecasting (future)
- AI-powered analysis (future)

# API Documentation

The backend exposes an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for all REST endpoints.

After starting the backend, the documentation is available at:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/docs
```

The OpenAPI specification is maintained inside the backend under:

```text
api/openapi/
```

using a modular organization based on:

- Components
- Schemas
- Paths

---

# Running the Project

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 22+
- npm

## Start the development environment

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Stop the environment

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

# Environment Variables

The backend requires an `.env` file inside the `api/` directory.

Example:

```env
PORT=3000

MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/business_dashboard

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret

JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES=15m

JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES=7d

STORAGE_PROVIDER=minio

MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio

MINIO_PORT=9000

MINIO_USE_SSL=false

MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=your_minio_access_key

MINIO_SECRET_KEY=your_minio_secret_key

MINIO_BUCKET=datasets

ANALYTICS_SERVICE_URL=http://analytics:8000

INTERNAL_API_KEY=your_internal_api_key
```

> `MINIO_*` and `INTERNAL_API_KEY` back the Dataset module's storage architecture — see [`docs/srs.md` §6](docs/srs.md#6-decisiones-arquitectónicas-almacenamiento-y-procesamiento-de-datasets) for the full design.
